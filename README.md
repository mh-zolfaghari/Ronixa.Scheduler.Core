## 📐 Ronixa.Scheduler.Core - Job Scheduler Project

The Ronixa.Scheduler.Core project is a .NET 8 application that implements task scheduling based on the IHostedService dependency structure. By implementing its simple and uncomplicated structure, you can perform an automated task at times that are completely independent of configuration. You can also use the information recorded by each task at runtime to store the output data of its execution process.
